      <h2>HTML Tutorials</h2>
      <p><b>HTML</b> stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It tells the web browser how to display text, links, images, and other forms of multimedia on a webpage.
             HTML sets up the basic structure of a website, and then CSS and JavaScript add style and interactivity to make it look and function better.</p>

      <p><i>How Does HTML Work? - HTML documents are plain-text files saved with an <big>.html extension</big>. Browsers read these documents, interpret the markup (tags and attributes), and render the formatted content on your screen.</i></p>
      <p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these 
            characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of 
            early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system.These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by 
            typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has
            been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>
